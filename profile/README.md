🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

The MAP (Multi-dimensional Analyses of Partonic distributions) collaboration is a pioneering initiative in the field of hadronic physics. 
It brings together a group of experts in QCD phenomenology to extract information about the distribution of partons inside hadrons across multidimensional momentum and configuration spaces. 
Key objects of study include Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs), Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), and Fragmentation Functions (FFs).
